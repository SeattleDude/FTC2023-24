Jobs for drive team:
    slow mode button for drive (could be a button, at states we used the left trigger on drive controller when it passed a 0.3/1.0 threshold)
    drive wheels (takes 2 joysticks from a controller)
    extension and rotation of arm (takes at least one joystick, both x and y or two joysticks)
    hand grip servos (toggle switch code for the bumpers)
    wrist servo (might be able to automate for perfect angling on the board (35 deg nominal))
    drone servo (only takes one button, but for safety we will want at least a 2 switch system)


% means the control is analog (0-1 on the triggers) (-1 to 1 on the joysticks)
